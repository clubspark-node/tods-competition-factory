## TODS → CODES: Competition Open Data Exchange Standards

Version 3.0 marks the formal transition from **TODS** (Tennis Open Data Standards) to **CODES** (Competition Open Data Exchange Standards). CODES builds on TODS rather than replacing it — any valid TODS document remains a valid CODES document. The transition reflects the reality that the factory's underlying data structures (participants, events, draws, matchUps, scoring) are not tennis-specific and translate naturally to any bracket-based competition sport.

### matchUpFormat Specification Expansion

The `matchUpFormatCode` parser and stringifier have been extended from a tennis-only grammar to a multi-sport format specification. This expansion was developed across late v2.4.x releases but was never formally documented or announced — v3.0 is its production debut.

#### Match Roots

Where the grammar previously assumed `SET` as the only root, v3.0 supports nine match roots:

| Root  | Domain     | Sports                                                                                       |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SET` | Sets/Games | Tennis, padel, pickleball, squash, badminton, table tennis, volleyball, fencing, racquetball |
| `HAL` | Halves     | Soccer, handball, NCAA basketball                                                            |
| `QTR` | Quarters   | NBA/FIBA basketball, water polo, lacrosse                                                    |
| `PER` | Periods    | Ice hockey, wrestling                                                                        |
| `INN` | Innings    | Baseball, wiffle ball                                                                        |
| `RND` | Rounds     | Boxing, MMA                                                                                  |
| `FRM` | Frames     | Table tennis (best-of-7+), badminton                                                         |
| `MAP` | Maps       | Esports (CS2, Valorant)                                                                      |
| `MAT` | Reserved   | Multi-match formats                                                                          |

Backward compatibility: `matchRoot` is only included in the parsed object when the root is not `SET`, so existing consumers are unaffected.

#### New Section Types

The format grammar previously supported two sections: `-S:` (set/segment format, required) and `-F:` (final segment override, optional). v3.0 adds two new sections:

**`-G:` Game Format** — specifies game-level scoring rules:

| Pattern  | Meaning                                 | Use Case                      |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `G:TN`   | Traditional tennis scoring (0-15-30-40) | Tennis, padel                 |
| `G:TN3D` | Traditional with deuce cap at 3rd deuce | Padel Star Point (2026 rules) |
| `G:TN1D` | Golden point (decisive at first deuce)  | Padel no-advantage            |
| `G:3C`   | 3 consecutive points to win             | TYPTI format                  |
| `G:3C3D` | Consecutive with deuce cap              | TYPTI variant                 |

**`-M:` Match Constraint** — match-level time cap across all segments:

| Pattern | Meaning                  | Use Case                       |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `M:T50` | 50-minute match time cap | Wiffle ball, timed tournaments |

#### New Set Format: Outs-Based Scoring

For innings-based sports (baseball, wiffle ball), a new `O{outs}` set format:

- `S:O3` — 3 outs per team per inning
- Example full format: `INN4XA-S:O3-M:T50` (4 innings exactly, aggregate scoring, 3 outs per side, 50-minute cap)

#### Match-Level Modifiers

| Modifier | Meaning                           | Example                    |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `X`      | Exactly N segments (not best-of)  | `SET7X-S:T10P`             |
| `A`      | Aggregate scoring across segments | `HAL2A-S:T45`              |
| `XA`     | Both exactly and aggregate        | `SET7XA-S:T10P` (INTENNSE) |

#### Full Grammar

```text
{ROOT}{count}[X][A]-S:{setSpec}[-G:{gameSpec}][-F:{setSpec}][-M:{matchConstraint}]
```

Or simplified form for single-set timed: `T{minutes}[P|G][/TB{n}][@modifier]`

#### Cross-Sport Format Examples

| Sport                  | Format Code                      | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Tennis (Grand Slam)    | `SET5-S:6/TB7-F:6/TB10`          | Best of 5, tiebreak at 6-6, final set TB10    |
| Padel Star Point       | `SET3-S:4/TB7@3-G:TN3D`          | Best of 3, TB at 3-3, star point games        |
| Pickleball (MLP rally) | `SET3-S:TB21@RALLY-F:TB15@RALLY` | Rally scoring to 21, final to 15              |
| INTENNSE               | `SET7XA-S:T10P`                  | Exactly 7 timed sets, aggregate, points-based |
| Soccer                 | `HAL2A-S:T45`                    | 2 halves, 45 min each, aggregate              |
| NBA Basketball         | `QTR4A-S:T12`                    | 4 quarters, 12 min each, aggregate            |
| Ice Hockey             | `PER3A-S:T20`                    | 3 periods, 20 min each, aggregate             |
| Boxing                 | `RND12A-S:T3`                    | 12 rounds, 3 min each, aggregate (judged)     |
| Wiffle Ball (BLW)      | `INN4XA-S:O3-M:T50`              | 4 innings, 3 outs, 50-min cap                 |
| Esports (CS2)          | `MAP3-S:TB13`                    | Best of 3 maps, first to 13 rounds            |
| Squash (PAR-11)        | `SET5-S:TB11`                    | Best of 5 games to 11                         |
| Table Tennis (7-game)  | `FRM7-S:TB11`                    | Best of 7 frames to 11                        |

#### Parsed Format Types

The `FormatStructure` type has been expanded with:

- `matchRoot?: string` — only present when not `SET`
- `aggregate?: boolean` — true when `A` modifier present
- `exactly?: number` — when `X` modifier used (mutually exclusive with `bestOf`)
- `gameFormat?: GameFormatStructure` — from `-G:` section (`type: 'TRADITIONAL' | 'CONSECUTIVE'`, `count?`, `deuceAfter?`)
- `matchUpConstraint?: MatchUpConstraintStructure` — from `-M:` section (`timed`, `minutes`)
- `SetFormatStructure.outs?: number` — for outs-based scoring

#### Validation Rules

- `SET` root: `bestOf < 6` for non-timed (use `FRM`/`RND`/etc. for higher counts)
- Exactly (`X`) with timed bypasses the bestOf limit (e.g., `SET7XA-S:T10P` is valid)
- Each section key (`S`, `F`, `G`, `M`) may appear at most once
- `-S:` is always required
- `isValidMatchUpFormat` correctly distinguishes timed basis `G` (as in `T10G`) from section key `-G:` via lookahead regex
- Round-trip guarantee: `stringify(parse(code)) === code` for all valid codes

#### matchUpFormat Test Coverage

- `crossSportFormats.test.ts` — 67 tests covering all match roots and sport formats
- `outs-scoring-engine.test.ts` — 140+ tests for innings/outs-based scoring
- `outsGenerateOutcome.test.ts` — 132 tests for outs-based outcome generation
- `matchUpFormatCode.test.ts`, `matchUpFormatPickle.test.ts` — core parser/stringify tests
- `mcpParser.test.ts`, `mcpValidator.test.ts`, `mcpParserCoverage.test.ts`, `mcpValidatorBranches.test.ts` — validator branch coverage

#### matchUpFormat Documentation

- `matchup-format.mdx` — complete format specification with sport reference tables (397 lines)
- `matchup-format-governor.md` — API documentation
- `data-standards.md` — CODES/TODS explanation and relationship

## Breaking Changes

### `CUSTOM` drawType removed

The `CUSTOM` drawType has been removed from `drawDefinitionConstants`. Any code importing `CUSTOM` or using `'CUSTOM'` as a drawType value will break. The ADAPTIVE draw type serves as the flexible alternative.

### `tidyScore` / scoreParser module removed

The entire `src/helpers/scoreParser/` module (22 files, ~2,730 lines) has been extracted into a separate project. Any code calling `tidyScore()` via the scoreGovernor must migrate to that standalone package.

### `PLAY_OFF` vs `PLAYOFF` draw type clarification

`PLAY_OFF` (with underscore) is now exclusively a **stage type** constant. A new `PLAYOFF` (no underscore) constant is the correct **draw type**. Code using `PLAY_OFF` as a drawType — including checks against `MULTI_STRUCTURE_DRAWS` — must switch to `PLAYOFF`.

### tieFormat fixture `tieFormatName` values renamed

All built-in tieFormat fixtures have been renamed from SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE to human-readable names:

| Old               | New                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `COLLEGE_D3`      | `College D3`            |
| `DOMINANT_DUO`    | `Dominant Duo`          |
| `LAVER_CUP`       | `Laver Cup`             |
| `USTA_BREWER_CUP` | `Brewer Cup`            |
| `USTA_COLLEGE`    | `USTA Collegiate`       |
| `USTA_TOC`        | `USTA Tennis on Campus` |
| `USTA_WTT_ITT`    | `World Team Tennis ITT` |

All other `USTA_*` and organization-prefixed formats have been similarly renamed. Any code matching on `tieFormatName` string values must be updated.

### `CountryCodeUnion` TypeScript type changed

Changed from `keyof typeof CountryCodeEnum` to `` `${CountryCodeEnum}` ``. The union members are now the enum values (e.g., `'USA'`) rather than enum keys. TypeScript consumers must update code typed against the old union shape.

### `side1PointScore` / `side2PointScore` type widened

The `Set` interface now types these as `number | string` (was `number`). TypeScript consumers may need to handle the string case.

### `EventTypeUnion` expanded

Now includes `'HYBRID'` in addition to `'SINGLES' | 'DOUBLES' | 'TEAM'`. Exhaustive switches and type guards must be updated.

### `ParticipantRoleEnum` expanded

Added: `DIRECTOR`, `HOSPITALITY`, `STRINGER`, `SUPERVISOR`, `TRANSPORT`, `VOLUNTEER`. Exhaustive checks must be updated.

### `generateVoluntaryConsolation` local attachment removed

The function no longer supports local attachment. Callers relying on this behavior must update their integration.

### `FORMAT_ATP_DOUBLES` corrected

Now correctly includes NOAD: `"SET3-S:6NOAD/TB7-F:TB10"`. The previous value was missing the NOAD modifier.

### Laver Cup fixture doubles matchUpFormat corrected

Changed from `"SET3-S:6/TB7-F:TB10"` to `"SET3-S:6NOAD/TB7-F:TB10"`.

### Scoring Engine

A consolidated, stateful scoring engine (`ScoringEngine`) that replaces the prior scattered history-based scoring code. The engine provides a unified API for point-by-point, game-level, set-level, and timed-segment scoring across multiple sport formats (tennis, pickleball, padel, INTENNSE, and more). Introduced in late v2.4.x but never formally released as stable — this is its debut as production-ready functionality.

The old history-based scoring files (`addGame.ts`, `addPoint.ts`, `addSet.ts`, `addShot.ts`, `calculateHistoryScore.ts`, `clearHistory.ts`, `getHistory.ts`, `redo.ts`) and the v3Adapter (1,022 lines) were removed and replaced by the unified engine.

**Constructor & State Management:**

- `constructor(options?)` — create with matchUpFormat, competitionFormat, event handlers
- `setState(matchUp)` — load a TODS MatchUp into the engine
- `getState()` — get the current MatchUp state
- `reset()` — clear all state and history

**Multi-Level Scoring Input:**

- `addPoint(options)` — primary point-by-point scoring entry point
- `addGame(options)` — game-level input (skipping point tracking)
- `addSet(options)` — set-level input
- `endSegment(options?)` — finalize timed segments (INTENNSE, timed formats)
- `setInitialScore(options)` — mid-match arrival setup (join scoring in progress)

**Undo/Redo:**

- `undo(count?)` / `redo(count?)` — full undo/redo with entry-based rebuild
- `canUndo()` / `canRedo()` / `getUndoDepth()` / `getRedoDepth()` — availability queries

**Score Queries:**

- `getScore()` — structured score object with sets, games, points
- `getScoreboard(options?)` — display-ready string (e.g., `"6-4 3-6 2-1 30-15"`)
- `getWinner()` — returns side 1 or 2, or undefined
- `isComplete()` — match completion check
- `getPointCount()` — total points played
- `getFormat()` — current matchUpFormat code

**Format Introspection:**

- `isNoAd()` — No-Advantage detection
- `getSetsToWin()` — sets needed to win
- `getTiebreakAt()` — game count triggering tiebreak (or null)
- `hasFinalSetTiebreak()` — final set tiebreak check
- `getFormatStructure()` — parsed format object
- `getInputMode()` — returns `'points'` | `'games'` | `'sets'` | `'mixed'` | `'none'`

**Statistics & Analysis:**

- `getStatistics(options?)` — comprehensive match statistics with optional set filtering
- `getStatObjects(options?)` — `StatObject[]` formatted for visualization consumers
- `getEpisodes()` — point history with contextual metadata (break points, set points, etc.)
- `getNextServer()` — returns 0 or 1 (which side serves next)

**Server Management:**

- `setServer(side)` — correct/set server tracking, including cross-set tracking fixes

**Substitution & Lineups:**

- `setLineUp(sideNumber, lineUp)` — set team roster
- `substitute(options)` — record player substitution mid-match
- `getActivePlayers()` — current active players per side

**Point Multipliers:**

- `setPointMultipliers(multipliers)` — configure power points, bonus points
- `getPointMultipliers()` — get current multiplier configuration

**Point Editing & Decoration:**

- `decoratePoint(index, metadata)` — attach custom metadata to history entries
- `editPoint(index, newData, options?)` — edit historical points with optional recalculation
- `markHardBoundary(options)` — prevent edit cascade past a boundary

**CompetitionFormat Profiles:**

- `getPenaltyProfile()` — penalty types and escalation rules
- `getPointProfile()` — point result types (ace, winner, fault, etc.)
- `getTimerProfile()` — timer rules for timed formats
- `getTimeoutRules()` — timeout configuration per side
- `getPenaltyBoxProfile()` — penalty box rules (INTENNSE)
- `getSubstitutionRules()` — substitution constraints
- `getPlayerRules()` — player availability rules

**Event Handlers:**

- `setEventHandlers(handlers?)` / `getEventHandlers()` — set/query callbacks for `onPoint`, `onGameComplete`, `onSetComplete`, `onMatchComplete`, `onUndo`, `onRedo`, `onReset`

**Persistence:**

- `getSupplementaryState()` — get redo stack and lineups for external storage
- `loadSupplementaryState(state)` — restore supplementary state on reload

**CompetitionFormat fixtures:** `INTENNSE_STANDARD.json`, `TENNIS_STANDARD.json`

**Test coverage:** `scoringEngineCoverage.test.ts` (1,733 lines), `engine-api-extensions.test.ts` (1,037 lines), `scoring-engine.test.ts` (295 lines), plus `undo-redo.test.ts`, `substitutions.test.ts`, `statistics.test.ts`, `addPoint.test.ts`, `mixed-game-point.test.ts`, `outs-scoring-engine.test.ts`, `pbp-validation.test.ts`, `pbpValidator.test.ts`, `pbpValidatorCoverage.test.ts`, `mcpParser.test.ts`, `mcpValidator.test.ts`

## Code Quality and Cognitive Complexity

### Systematic Complexity Reduction

A comprehensive refactoring effort reduced cognitive complexity across the entire codebase. Every function in the factory now scores below 30 on the SonarQube cognitive complexity metric — down from a starting point where 93 functions exceeded that threshold, with some reaching 184.

| Metric                        | Before | After | Reduction |
| ----------------------------- | -----: | ----: | --------- |
| Functions above complexity 50 |     36 |     0 | -100%     |
| Functions above complexity 40 |     62 |     0 | -100%     |
| Functions above complexity 30 |     93 |     0 | -100%     |
| Helper functions extracted    |      — |  ~200 | —         |
| Source files refactored       |      — |   ~60 | —         |

Monolithic functions were decomposed into focused, testable helpers — for example, `getParticipantEntries` (718 lines, one function) was split into 8 helpers across 4 refactoring passes. The same treatment was applied to scoring, scheduling, draw positioning, publishing, ranking, tie format management, and mock generation code.

The `sonarjs/cognitive-complexity` ESLint rule is now enabled at threshold 30, enforcing the quality floor for all new code.

### Test File Linting

Test files (`*.test.ts`) are now included in the ESLint configuration. Previously ignored, 590 lint issues were identified and resolved:

- 94 unused variable/import errors eliminated
- 52 useless assignment warnings fixed
- Duplicate branches, nested ternaries, stale directives, and missing callback returns cleaned up
- Test-specific overrides for `no-duplicate-string` and `no-empty-function` (intentional patterns in test code)

### TypeScript Modernization

- Removed deprecated `baseUrl` and `downlevelIteration` tsconfig options (no-ops at ES2021 target, deprecated for TypeScript 7.0)
- Fixed bare `src/` imports to use path aliases

## mocksEngine Improvements

### Deterministic Generation

A `nonRandom` seed parameter has been added to mocksEngine, enabling fully deterministic and reproducible tournament generation. Uses a seeded PRNG (`src/tools/prng.ts`) so that the same seed always produces identical draws, participants, and outcomes. Essential for snapshot testing and CI reproducibility.

### Exported Primitives

Internal generation primitives are now exported for end-user testing frameworks:

- `generateOutcome`
- `completeDrawMatchUps`
- `generateEventWithDraw`
- `removeMatchUpOutcome`

This allows consumers to build custom testing harnesses on top of factory's mock infrastructure without depending on internal APIs.

### Expanded Generation Capabilities

- **Team size override:** `generateParticipants` accepts an explicit team size parameter to override calculated size
- **participantRole support:** Mock participant generation now accepts `participantRole`
- **Timed format completion:** `completeDrawMatchUps` correctly handles timed match formats
- **HYBRID event generation:** Mocks can generate HYBRID events with mixed INDIVIDUAL/PAIR participants
- **Lucky draw scenarios:** Extended scenario generation and completion logic for Lucky Draw structures
- **Recursive playoff directives:** `generateDrawDefinition` / `generateEventWithDraw` support recursive playoff structure specification

### mocksEngine Documentation

Seven new documentation files covering the full mocksEngine surface:

- `mocks-engine-overview.md`
- `mocks-engine-getting-started.md`
- `mocks-engine-tournament-generation.md`
- `mocks-engine-participants.md`
- `mocks-engine-outcomes.md`
- `mocks-engine-patterns.md`

## Swiss System Draw Type

A full **Swiss System** implementation for multi-round tournament pairing, built on the Ad Hoc draw infrastructure.

### Pairing Algorithm

- **Round 1:** FIDE-style pairing — sort participants by rating (descending), split into top and bottom halves, pair top vs bottom (1v5, 2v6, 3v7, 4v8 for 8 players)
- **Subsequent rounds:** Score-group pairing — group participants by W-L record, apply FIDE-style pairing within each group
- **Floating:** When a score group has an odd count, the lowest-rated participant floats down to the next group
- **Repeat avoidance:** Encounter tracking via pairing hash prevents re-matching opponents
- **Bye handling:** Odd participant count assigns bye to the lowest-rated participant in the lowest score group

### Rating Scale Support

TMX exposes a rating scale selector for Swiss draws (same dropdown as DrawMatic). The selected scale is stored as a `swissScaleName` extension on the draw definition and passed through on each `generateSwissRound` call.

### Standings and Tiebreakers

`getSwissStandings` returns ranked standings with four tiebreaker methods:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| BUCHHOLZ | Sum of all opponents' scores |
| MEDIAN_BUCHHOLZ | Buchholz excluding highest and lowest opponent scores |
| SONNEBORN_BERGER | Sum of defeated opponents' scores plus half the drawn opponents' scores |
| PROGRESSIVE_SCORE | Cumulative sum of round-by-round cumulative point totals |

### Swiss Chart

`getSwissChart` returns per-round snapshots of score groups for visualization — each round contains nodes with participant lists grouped by their W-L-D record.

### Key Methods

- `generateSwissRound({ drawId })` — generates the next round of Swiss pairings
- `addAdHocMatchUps({ matchUps, structureId, drawId })` — adds generated matchUps to the draw
- `getSwissStandings({ drawId })` — returns ranked standings with tiebreaker values
- `getSwissChart({ drawId })` — returns score-group chart data for visualization

### Competition Policy Integration

Swiss draws support the new `POLICY_TYPE_COMPETITION` for three-track rating evaluation. When a competition policy is attached with `pairingPolicy.method: 'SWISS'`, the Swiss pairing algorithm uses dynamic form ratings from the competition state instead of raw scale values.

---

## Competition Policy (Three-Track Rating System)

A new `POLICY_TYPE_COMPETITION` policy type enables multi-round competition evaluation with three distinct rating tracks. This is the architecture described in the "Luck vs. Skill" specification — a system where dynamic ratings affect opportunity (pairing) but never evaluation (pressure scoring).

### Three Rating Tracks

| Track | Mutability | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Baseline Rating** | Frozen during event | Defines expected performance; source of pressure expectations |
| **Dynamic Form Rating** | Updated each round | Drives pairing; ensures competitive matches via Elo-like updates |
| **Pressure Rating** | Cumulative | Measures overperformance vs baseline expectation; determines winner |

### Core Invariant

**Dynamic ratings affect opportunity, never evaluation.** The pressure rating always uses the frozen baseline for expectation calculation, preventing a feedback loop where early overperformance inflates expectations.

### Processing Granularity

The policy supports two processing modes:

- **PER_MATCHUP** — ratings update automatically in the scoring pipeline after each matchUp outcome is finalized
- **PER_ROUND** — ratings update in batch when `processCompetitionRound` is called (typically at round generation time)

### Rating Math

- **Expected score:** Logistic function `E = 1 / (1 + 10^((Rj - Ri) / S))` with configurable logistic scale
- **Actual output:** Format-agnostic — derives countable scoring units (games, points, sets) from any matchUp format
  - `POINT_SHARE` mode: `pointsWon / totalPoints`
  - `WEIGHTED` mode: configurable weights for point share, point differential, and context factor
- **Pressure delta:** `actualOutput - expectedOutput` (always baseline-based)
- **Dynamic form update:** `R_new = R_old + K * (actualOutput - dynamicExpected)`

### Victory Policy

Configurable primary ranking (`PRESSURE_RATING`, `DYNAMIC_FORM_RATING`, `WINS`, `POINTS`) with ordered tiebreakers including `HEAD_TO_HEAD`, `HEAD_TO_HEAD_PRESSURE`, `POINT_DIFFERENTIAL`, `STRENGTH_OF_OPPOSITION`, `BUCHHOLZ`, `SONNEBORN_BERGER`.

### Preset Fixtures

| Fixture | Pairing | Primary Ranking | Processing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POLICY_COMPETITION_STANDARD | DrawMatic | WINS | PER_ROUND |
| POLICY_COMPETITION_PRESSURE | DrawMatic | PRESSURE_RATING | PER_MATCHUP |
| POLICY_COMPETITION_SWISS | Swiss | WINS + BUCHHOLZ tiebreak | PER_ROUND |

### Pairing Integration

When a competition policy is present, `generateDrawMaticRound` and `generateSwissRound` automatically use dynamic form ratings from the competition state instead of raw scale values or the legacy `dynamicRatings` system. The existing DrawMatic value function, encounter tracking, and candidate generation are fully reused.

### New competitionGovernor Methods

**Mutations:** `initializeCompetitionState`, `processCompetitionMatchUp`, `processCompetitionRound`, `resetCompetitionState`

**Queries:** `getCompetitionState`, `getCompetitionPolicy`, `getCompetitionLeaderboard`, `getCompetitionParticipantState`

### State Management

Competition state is stored as a `competitionState` extension on the draw definition. It contains per-participant states (baseline, dynamic form, pressure ratings, W/L/D records, rating history) and per-round states (processing status, lane assignments).
