## Profile Selection

When a participant has a `structureParticipation` entry, `getAwardProfile` finds the best matching `awardProfile` from the policy.

### Specificity Scoring

Profiles are scored by counting their populated scope fields. A profile that specifies `drawTypes`, `levels`, and `maxDrawSize` (score 3) beats a catch-all profile with no scope constraints (score 0).

**Scored fields** (1 point each):

| Field                | Matches Against                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `eventTypes`         | `event.eventType`                           |
| `drawTypes`          | `drawDefinition.drawType`                   |
| `drawSizes`          | `drawDefinition.drawSize`                   |
| `maxDrawSize`        | `drawDefinition.drawSize <= maxDrawSize`    |
| `stages`             | `structureParticipation.rankingStage`       |
| `stageSequences`     | `structureParticipation.stageSequence`      |
| `levels`             | `level` parameter                           |
| `maxLevel`           | `level <= maxLevel`                         |
| `flights`            | `structureParticipation.flightNumber`       |
| `maxFlightNumber`    | `flightNumber <= maxFlightNumber`           |
| `participationOrder` | `structureParticipation.participationOrder` |
| `dateRanges`         | `startDate`/`endDate` within range          |
| `category.*`         | Each populated CategoryScope field          |

**Priority override:** If any matching profile has an explicit `priority` number, the highest priority wins regardless of specificity score.

### CategoryScope Matching

The `category` field on an `awardProfile` uses `CategoryScope` to match against the event's competitive context:

```js
category: {
  ageCategoryCodes: ['U18'],        // event.category.ageCategoryCode
  genders: ['MALE'],                // event.gender
  categoryNames: ['Junior'],        // event.category.categoryName
  categoryTypes: ['AGE'],           // event.category.type
  ratingTypes: ['WTN'],             // event.category.ratingType
  ballTypes: ['GREEN'],             // event.category.ballType
  wheelchairClasses: ['QUAD'],      // event.wheelchairClass
  subTypes: ['ADVANCED'],           // event.category.subType
}
```

Each field uses contains semantics: if the scope field is present, the event value must be in the array. Absent fields match everything.

## Position Points

Position points are determined by the participant's [`finishingPositionRange`](/docs/concepts/finishing-positions) — a numeric range representing where they finished in the draw structure.

### The Accessor

For **main draw** and **consolation** stages:

```js
const accessor = Math.max(...finishingPositionRange);
```

The accessor is used to look up points in the profile's `finishingPositionRanges`:

| Finish                     | finishingPositionRange | accessor | Policy key |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Champion                   | `[1, 1]`               | `1`      | `1`        |
| Runner-up                  | `[2, 2]`               | `2`      | `2`        |
| SF losers (no 3-4 playoff) | `[3, 4]`               | `4`      | `4`        |
| 3rd place (with playoff)   | `[3, 3]`               | `3`      | `3`        |
| QF losers                  | `[5, 8]`               | `8`      | `8`        |
| R16 losers                 | `[9, 16]`              | `16`     | `16`       |

:::tip
In draws without a 3rd-place playoff (standard single elimination), both semifinal losers get `finishingPositionRange: [3, 4]` and accessor `4`. Set the key `4` value to your intended "semifinal loser" points.

### Qualifying Position Normalization

For **QUALIFYING** stages, the raw `finishingPositionRange` from the factory is relative to the qualifying draw size (e.g., `[4, 4]` for a qualifier in an 8→4 qualifying draw). However, ranking policies use a normalized convention where positions map to qualifying outcomes rather than draw positions:

| Qualifying outcome                   | Normalized accessor | Policy key |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ---------- |
| Qualifier (won through to main draw) | `1`                 | `1`        |
| Final round loser (FRQ)              | `2`                 | `2`        |
| 2nd round loser                      | `4`                 | `4`        |
| 1st round loser                      | `8`                 | `8`        |

The pipeline automatically normalizes qualifying accessors using the participant's `finishingRound`:

```js
if (rankingStage === QUALIFYING) {
  if (participantWon) {
    accessor = 1; // Qualifier
  } else {
    accessor = Math.pow(2, finishingRound); // 1→2, 2→4, 3→8, etc.
  }
}
```

This means qualifying profiles only need to define keys `1`, `2`, `4`, `8`, etc. — regardless of the actual qualifying draw size.

:::tip
All built-in policies (ATP, WTA, ITF WTT) use this normalized convention. When writing custom qualifying profiles, use position `1` for qualifiers, `2` for final-round losers, etc.
:::

### Position Value Resolution

The value at each policy key can be:

- **Simple number**: `{ 1: 1000 }` — 1000 points regardless of level
- **Level-keyed**: `{ 1: { level: { 1: 1000, 2: 500, 3: 300 } } }` — varies by tournament level
- **Draw size threshold**: `{ 1: [{ threshold: 16, value: 800 }, { threshold: 32, value: 1000 }] }` — varies by draw size
- **Flight-specific**: `{ 1: { flights: { 1: 1000, 2: 500 } } }` — varies by flight number

### Multi-Structure Draws

For draws with multiple structures (FIC, Curtis Consolation, Compass), participants may have `structureParticipation` entries in multiple structures. The pipeline iterates all entries and takes the **maximum position points** across structures (see [Multi-Structure Draws](/docs/concepts/finishing-positions#multi-structure-draws)):

```text
Main draw R2 loser:      accessor 24 -> 75 pts
Consolation SF finisher:  accessor 12 -> 150 pts
Final position points:    150 pts (consolation finish is better)
```

This happens automatically — no special policy configuration is needed for multi-structure draws.

## Per-Win Points

Per-win points are awarded when a participation has no position points (the accessor doesn't match any `finishingPositionRanges` key) or through a dedicated per-win config.

### Simple Per-Win

```js
awardProfile: {
  pointsPerWin: 60, // flat value per match won
}
```

### Level-Keyed Per-Win

```js
awardProfile: {
  perWinPoints: {
    level: { 1: 300, 2: 225, 3: 150 }
  }
}
```

### maxCountableMatches

Caps the number of wins counted for per-win points per participant per draw:

```js
awardProfile: {
  maxCountableMatches: 5,
  // or level-keyed:
  maxCountableMatches: { level: { 3: 5, 4: 4 } },
}
```

When a participant has wins across multiple structures (e.g., qualifying + main draw), the cap applies cumulatively across all participations sharing the same award profile.

## Bonus Points

Champion and finalist bonuses based on the participant's best finishing position across all structures in a draw:

```js
awardProfile: {
  bonusPoints: [
    { finishingPositions: [1], value: { level: { 6: 50, 7: 25 } } },
    { finishingPositions: [2], value: { level: { 6: 30, 7: 15 } } },
  ],
}
```

The `bestFinishingPosition` is `Math.min(finishingPositionRange)` — the best position the participant could have achieved.

## Doubles Attribution

Controls how pair (doubles) points flow to individual participants:

```js
rankingPolicy: {
  doublesAttribution: 'fullToEach', // or 'splitEven'
}
```

| Mode           | Effect                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `'fullToEach'` | Each individual receives 100% of pair points               |
| `'splitEven'`  | Each individual receives 50% of pair points (rounded)      |
| Not set        | Points only on pair record, not distributed to individuals |

## PointAward Output

Each award in `personPoints` contains a granular breakdown:

```ts
{
  positionPoints: 500,       // from finishingPositionRanges
  perWinPoints: 225,         // from per-win config
  bonusPoints: 50,           // from bonusPoints config
  points: 775,               // total: position + perWin + bonus
  winCount: 3,               // total wins in this draw
  rangeAccessor: 4,          // finishingPositionRange accessor used
  eventType: 'SINGLES',
  drawId: 'draw-abc',
  drawType: 'SINGLE_ELIMINATION',
  category: { ageCategoryCode: 'U18' },
  level: 3,
  startDate: '2025-06-01',
  endDate: '2025-06-07',
  pointsAuthority: 'ATP',    // copied from policy.pointsAuthority (optional)
}
```

The `pointsAuthority` field is copied from the source policy at award time
(see [Ranking Policy → Points Authority](/docs/policies/rankingPolicy#points-authority)).
It rides through every emitted award shape — main awards, doubles-split
individual awards, quality-win awards, and team line-points awards — so
federated ranking generators can scope and weight by source authority without
re-joining to policy metadata. The field is `undefined` when the source policy
did not declare a `pointsAuthority`.
